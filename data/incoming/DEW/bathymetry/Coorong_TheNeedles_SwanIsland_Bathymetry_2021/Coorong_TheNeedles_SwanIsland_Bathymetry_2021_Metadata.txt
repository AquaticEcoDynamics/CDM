Coorong Elevation & Bathymetry (The Needles to Swan Island Bathymetry 2021 update)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
The Coorong (The Needles to Swan Island) digital elevation model (DEM) is a composite terrestrial elevation and bathymetry product based on lidar elevation data from 2018 (and partial 2008), elevation survey data (i.e. ground and boat sonar surveys, March 2021), water level monitoring sites and high-resolution satellite imagery from 2021-02-15.

Lineage:
The Coorong (The Needles to Swan Island) digital elevation model (DEM) was constructed in May 2021 using: a) Digital Elevation Model 2018 (DEM, 1m grid) based on lidar data (May 22, 2018); b) Lidar 2008 points (~2m x,y point resolution, April 6-10, 2008); c) Elevation and bathymetry points (ground and sonar surveys, March 2021); d) Sentinel-2 satellite data (10m grid, 4 bands), 2021-02-15, 00:47:00UTC (10:17:00CST); e) Hydrograph points, 2021-02-15 (within 5 minutes of Sentinel satellite pass-over).

The updated elevation surface is a hybrid of boat and ground point survey data and a Sentinel-based DEM where point survey data is absent (i.e. >10m from ground or boat surveys). It has been processed using the ArcGIS TopoToRaster function (natural neighbours). Minor inconsistencies exist between elevations using survey point and Sentinel DEM datasets (typically <0.2m RMSE) and can result in minor patterns of noise within the DEM coverage and contour mapping. Lowest survey points in each transect have been used to map the approximate location of major channel centrelines.
