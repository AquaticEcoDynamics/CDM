ADV Sampling Metadata,,,
Sample,"The sequence of samples from the start of data collection for each sampling block, beginning by 1.",,
SampleTime,Date (DD/MM/YYYY) and time (HH:MM) at which sample was taken.,,
V1/X/E,Water velocity (cm/s) in the due north direction.,,
V2/Y/N,Water velocity (cm/s) in the due west direction.,,
V3/Z/U,Water velocity (cm/s) in the up direction (from bottom of water column upwards).,,
Amp1,"Amplitude of the signal strength for acoustic receiver of V1. Signal strength is a measure of the intensity of the reflected acoustic signal in counts  (0 to 255). One count equals 0.43 dB. Without sufficient signal strength, the ADV is unable to make accurate velocity measurements.",,
Amp2,Amplitude of the signal strength for acoustic receiver of V2.,,
Amp3,Amplitude of the signal strength for acoustic receiver of V3.,,
Corr1,"Correlation value (0 to 100%, 0 = no coherent signal, 100 = perfect correlation) for acoustic receiver of V1. The correlation coefficient is a data quality parameter that is a direct output of the Doppler velocity calculations.",,
Corr2,Correlation value for acoustic receiver of V2.,,
Corr3,Correlation value for acoustic receiver of V3.,,
SNR1,Signal to noise ratio for acoustic receiver 1. Signal to noise ratio is an alternate measure of the signal strength in dB. Signal to noise ratio is derived from signal amplitude by subtracting the ambient noise level and converting to units of dB.,,
SNR2,Signal to noise ratio for acoustic receiver 2.,,
SNR3,Signal to noise ratio for acoustic receiver 3.,,
MeanSNR,Mean signal to noise ratio of all three receivers. ,,
MeanVel,Mean velocity of all three receivers.,,
MeanAmp,Mean signal strength of all three receivers.,,
MeanCorr,Mean correlation of all three receivers.,,
Site,Site at which  the data was taken (Policeman Point Boat Ramp or Villa dei Yumpa).,,
,ADV coordinates at each site,,
,Site,Latitude,Longitude
