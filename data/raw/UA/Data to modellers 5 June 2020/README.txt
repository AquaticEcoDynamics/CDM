-	Map of water quality sites (that comprise the main lagoon water quality dataset)
-	Sub-folder with python script to process and graph the raw data, includes reading some corresponding hydrology files in that folder for water quality plots

Sediment quality folder:
-	Maps of sediment quality sites (three maps for whole of Coorong, South Lagoon, and North Lagoon), 50 sites in total
-	Excel file “Coorong_March_2020_Final Field Results and Photos” which has field descriptions, photos and Rapid Assessment Protocol measurements for 50 sites using Hallett et al. 2019 paper approach
