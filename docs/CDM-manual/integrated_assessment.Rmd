# Integrated assessment of the CDM

## Overview

The previous chapters have detailed the nature of the model setup, additions and areas of development. In this section, the model is assessed in its entirety, using the fully-coupled model, against the complete data-set. A range of metrics are used for a large number of predicted variable and different sites.

To Be Completed

## Long-term simulation performance

With the *Generation I* compiled boundary conditions (tide, barrages, Salt Ck inflows) and BARRA weather forcing, the performance of the model in reproducing the long-term nutrient pools has been examined.

Example model outcomes against the field observations of TN and TP are shown in Figure 10 & 11, and a summary of model performance is provided in Table 1. In summary, the model predicted well the temporal and spatial variations in TN and TP concentrations. However, the model has been shown to poorly predict the phytoplankton concentration in the South Coorong. A reason for this may be due to the current CDM being in in 2D mode which assumes the water column is fully mixed; whilst the phytoplankton samples were taken in the surface water where the phytoplankton can accumulate. The release of bioavailable nutrients is also subject to change once the sediment modelling is completed and the accuracy resolving bioavailable nutrients is still weak. A further examination of phytoplankton and nutrient data is underway, and a 3D Coorong model is under development to capture the vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass.

## Nutrient budget assessment

A methodology for nutrient flux and budget analysis has been developed. For the nutrient budget analysis, all of the nutrient pools (dissolved and particulate carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, macroalgae and Ruppia) can be summarized for different regions of the estuary (north, south etc.). As an example of this method, the results from a period of three years (July 2017 to July 2020) were summarized for each region (Figure 5). Fluxes into and out of a region are shown. For the nutrient flux analysis we have developed script for calculating the salt and nutrient fluxes through selected node-string. This method is e ideal for comparing hydrology and water quality response in different operational scenarios.


```{r ass-pic1, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image", fig.cap = "South Lagoon region nutrient input/output loads for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus for the e-water simulation July 2017 to July 2020. Negative fluxes are material leaving the region to Upper Salt Creek region. There is a high build-up of macroalgae predicted after the winter release and nutrient pulse."}
